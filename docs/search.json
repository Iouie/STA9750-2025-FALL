Since its debut in 2016, Stranger Things has captivated and garnered a worldwide audience, jump starting the trajectory of many Netflix original series that we know and love today. From the Upside Down to the Overworld, there will be a world where Stranger Things will reclaim its throne as Netflix’s most popular TV show.\nThroughout it’s 4 seasons, Stranger Things has amassed 423,997,143 daily viewers.\n\n\nCode\nGLOBAL_TOP_10 |&gt; select(show_title, weekly_hours_viewed) |&gt; filter(show_title ==\n                                                                     'Stranger Things') |&gt;\n  group_by(show_title) |&gt; summarise(total_weekly_hrs_stranger_things = sum(weekly_hours_viewed)) |&gt;\n  mutate(daily_hours_viewed =\n           total_weekly_hrs_stranger_things / 7)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  show_title      total_weekly_hrs_stranger_things daily_hours_viewed\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                      &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Stranger Things                       2967980000         423997143.\n\n\nOut of the 94 countries that Netflix operates in, Stranger Things have been in the top 10 for 93 of them with an average of 13 consecutive weeks in the top 10.\n\n\nCode\nnum_countries_top10 &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |&gt; \n  select(country_name, show_title, cumulative_weeks_in_top_10) |&gt; \n  filter(show_title =='Stranger Things') |&gt; \n  group_by(country_name) |&gt; \n  summarise(num_countries = n_distinct(cumulative_weeks_in_top_10))\n\nweekly_consecutive_top10_avg &lt;- sum(num_countries_top10$num_countries) / 93\n\nnum_countries_top10 |&gt; \n    datatable(options=list(paging=TRUE, searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |&gt; \n  formatStyle(columns = names(num_countries_top10),\n              color ='white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Stranger Things to the 7 TV shows that hit top 10 during its debut week in 94 different countries, Stranger Things ranks as the 2nd highest total weekly hours only behind the cultural phenomenon Squid Game. Nearly a decade after its debut, Stranger Things continue to prove its staying power and relevance in the ever changing landscape of TV shows.

Hindi films have started to make strides and hitting top weekly charts. The Hindi film RRR (Hindi) has been in the top 10 cumulatively for 18 weeks. The show has a weekly hour view of 79,780,000. Don’t sleep on the other films either!

On January 6, 2025, WWE will officially be streamed live on Netflix. WWE fans will now be able to stream shows at anywhere, anytime, and on any device. Thousands of new audiences have already flocked in to watch WWE’s special Pay-Per-Views resulting in WWE getting into the weekly top 10 in 42 different countries!\n\n\nCode\nwwe_tv &lt;- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %&gt;% filter(str_detect(show_title, \"WWE\"))\n\n#get count of unique countries\nwwe_tv %&gt;% summarise(unique_count = n_distinct(country_name))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  unique_count\n         &lt;int&gt;\n1           42\n\n\nCode\nworld_map &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nworld_map &lt;- world_map %&gt;%\n  mutate(highlight = admin %in% wwe_tv$country_name)\n\nggplot(world_map) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = highlight), color = \"grey80\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red\", \"FALSE\" = \"black\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the map above, we can see that WWE has a strong presence in North America, South America, Europe, and parts of Asia. However, there are still many countries in Africa and the Middle East that have yet to embrace the thrill of WWE. With Netflix’s global reach, WWE has the potential to expand its audience and bring the excitement of wrestling to new regions. Speaking of regions, the graph below shows the number of times a WWE show has hit the weekly top 10. It’s not surprising that the 2 biggest events, WrestleMania and SummerSlam, are the most popular show.\n\n\nCode\ncountry_count &lt;- wwe_tv %&gt;%\n  group_by(show_title) %&gt;%\n  summarise(num_countries = n_distinct(country_name))\n\nggplot(country_count, aes(x= reorder(show_title, num_countries), y=num_countries)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#375b7f\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x =\"WWE Shows\", y = \"# of Countries that WWE Hit Top 10\", title = \"WWE Popularity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated: Sunday 10 12, 2025 at 13:14PM"
